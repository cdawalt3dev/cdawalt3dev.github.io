			Over the summer of 2019, I was given a project to restore an old employee management service that had been shelved for over a decade.
		  </p>
          <p class="pContent"> 
			The site acted as an interface for job-related information stored in a Postgre database.  It was easier to use than entering SQL into a Postgre console to change and view information.
		  </p>
		  <p class="pContent"> 
			With some assistance from the site's original developer, I was able to run the site as a local server with the same versions of Apache, Postgre, and PHP provided by old installers archived alongside the site.  However, using old network-related tools and software posed a security risk today.  I replaced the dependencies with modern versions and updated portions of the PHP files and structural PostgreSQL script that relied on old, deprecated, or renamed commands/calls.
		  </p>
		  <p class="pContent"> 
			The site can run on an Apache server with or without a domain in mind.  The loopback address (127.0.0.1) can also be used.  Calls are made to the Postgre server which is expected to be running separately.  I created sample users to test the site with full permissions as well as minimal permissions to mimic the roles of an administrator and a typical user.  It works as expected, walling off several portions of the site when logged in as the 'notadmin' user.
		  </p>
		  <p class="pContent"> 
			The Postgre database was originally given data from the MAS system.  It would not be feasible nor beneficial to restore MAS as it is propietary and no longer used by the company.  Making the service compatible with a new database format or writing data from the new database format to the existing Postgre format are a few options that may be taken in the future, as well as finding a suitable means of hosting it for a company intranet.
