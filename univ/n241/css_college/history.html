  <h1> History Before Electronics </h1>
  <p class="pIntroduction"> Progress was slow at first. Real progress could be seen in the 1600's, with increasingly wide use after the 1800's.</p>

  <h2>Before Mechanical Calculators</h2>
  <div class="divGroup">
    <h3>Addition, Subtraction</h3>
    <div class="divTextGroup">
      <p class="pContent"> For a long time, the abacus, invented around 2000 B.C., was the closest thing to a calculator. It was made of several columns of beads, each representing a ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, etc. place. Beads on each column could be moved to count, moving one to the next column when the current one is full and resetting all previous columns.</p>

    <h3>Multiplication, Division</h3>
    <div class="divTextGroup">
      <p class="pContent"> The next milestone was the slide rule, invented sometime after 1620 by William Oughtred. It could assist with multiplication and division at first but was later enhanced to support exponents, logarithms, and trigonometry. It can come in a circular form or a linear form that resembles a ruler. </p>

  <h2>Mechanical Calculators</h2>
  <div class="divGroup">
    <h3>The First Calculator</h3>
    <div class="divTextGroup">
      <p class="pContent"> The first mechanical calculator prototype was made by Wilhelm Schickard in 1623. He planned on supporting addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Unfortunately, his progress was lost in a house fire. </p>

  <div class="divGroup">
    <h3>The First Practical Calculator</h3>
    <div class="divTextGroup">
      <p class="pContent"> The first working mechanical calculator was invented by Blaise Pascal in 1642. He planned on supporting these four arithmetic operations too, but the device only supported addition and subtraction. </p>

  <div class="divGroup">
    <h3>All Four Operations</h3>
    <div class="divTextGroup">
      <p class="pContent"> The first calculator to support all four standard arithmetic operations was the Arithmometer, invented in 1820 by Thomas de Colmar. Several copies of the device were made between the mid 19th and early 20th centuries. </p>

    <h3>Introducing Buttons</h3>
    <div class="divTextGroup">
      <p class="pContent"> The first calulator to have buttons was the Comptometer. It was patented by Dorr. E. Felt in 1887.</p>

    <h3>The Portable Mechanical Calculator</h3>
    <div class="divTextGroup">
      <p class="pContent"> The last major milestone of mechanical calculators took place in 1948 with the release of the Curta calculator. It was small enough to fit in one's pocket.</p>
