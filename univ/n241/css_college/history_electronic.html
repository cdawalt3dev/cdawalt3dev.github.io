  <h1> History of Electronic Calculators </h1>
  
  <br/>
  <p class="pIntroduction"> Although large scale computers were in effect starting with the ENIAC computer in 1946, personal electronic calcualtors were not possible until the 1960's. Development exploded with the advent of transistors in the mid 1960's.</p>
  <br/>
  
  <h2> Before Transistors </h2>
  <div class="divGroup">
    <h3>The Personal Solution</h3>
    <div class="divTextGroup">
      <p class="pContent"> In 1961, Control Systems Ltd. released ANITA, the first electronic personal calculator. It used buttons to send signals. It used vacuum and cathode tubes to do math. </p>

    <h3>Early Transistor-Based Calculators</h3>
    <div class="divTextGroup">
        <p class="pGroupDescription"> Several transistor-based calculators emerged, introducing several pieces of modern personal computers. </p>
        <br/>
        <p class="pContent"> The Toscal BC-1411, released by Toshiba in 1965, used a primative form of RAM. </p>
        <br/>
        <p class="pContent"> The Olivetti Programma 101, also released in 1965, could read from and write to magnetic cards, as well as print results on paper. </p>
        <br/>
        <p class="pContent"> The Friden EC-130, released in 1963, featured a CRT display for showing results.</p>

    <h3>Square Root</h3>
    <div class="divTextGroup">
      <p class="pContent"> The ELKA 22, created by Bulgaria's Central Institute for Calculation Technologies in 1966, was the first calculator to have a square root feature.</p>

    <h3>Portable Calculators</h3>
    
    <div class="divTextGroup">
        <p class="pGroupDescription"> Portability and efficiency were the next prioritiees.</p>
        <br/>
        <p class="pContent"> The Cal Tech calculator, released in 1967 by Texas Instruments, could perform the four standard arithmetic operations, print on paper, and was small enough to fit in one's hands. It still required a lot of power.</p>
        <br/>
        <p class="pContent"> Sharp's QT-B Micro Compet calculator, released in 1969, was also portable and efficient enough to be powered by batteries.</p>
        <br/>
        <p class="pContent"> The LE-120 "Handy" calculator, released by Busicom in 1971, could fit in one's pocket.</p>

    <h3>Scientific Calculators</h3>
    <div class="divTextGroup">
      <p class="pContent"> Hewlett Packard released the HP-35 calculator in 1972, a larger scientific calculator. It was capable of doing algebra and trigonometry.</p>

    <h3>Affordable Calculators</h3>
    
    <div class="divTextGroup">
        <p class="pGroupDescription"> With improvements in design and manufacturing, prices dropped drastically. However, this resulted in a drop in quality at first.</p>
        <br/>
        <p class="pContent"> The Cambridge, released by Sinclair in 1973, cost only 30 Euros but encountered errors doing complex expressions.</p>
        <br/>
        <p class="pContent"> In 1974, the TI-2550 calculator boasted a low price tag of $9.95. </p>

        <p class="pGroupDescription"> Energy efficiency emerged as a priority yet again.</p>
        <br/>
        <p class="pContent"> The EL-805 calculator, released by Sharp in 1973, used a liquid crystal display (LCD), using minimal power to show a number.</p>
        <br/>
        <p class="pContent"> The Teal Photon, released by TEAL industries in 1978, was the first calculator to have a solar cell.</p>
