    <h3>Ideal Viewing Conditions</h3>
    
    <div class="divTextGroup">
      <p>The main site itself was viewed with the top 3 browsers - Microsoft Edge 41.16299.371.0, Mozilla Firefox 52.7.2, and Google Chrome 65.0.3325.181 - with little to no difference in performance or appearance.
      However, the Bibliography is best viewed in Firefox. When viewed in Edge or Chrome, the entry beginning with a double quote put the beginning quotation mark in an incorrect place.</p><br/>

      <p>index.html and modern.html were tested to see how long it took to connect to a simple web page and one with many images. A test at webpagetest.org took almost one second to load the index.html and 2.7 seconds to load modern.html. These speeds are consistent among all browsers.</p><br/>
      <br/>
      <p>The site is best viewed in a browser window no less than 1050 pixels wide for the content pages. The form at index.html requires more width. Zooming out by a small amount can help the site fit on screens that are less wide.</p>
