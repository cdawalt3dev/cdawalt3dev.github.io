      <p class="pQuestion">1. What parts of your project did you revise? Why?</p><br/>
      <p>I made the footer sticky for all pages. That is, if the window is greater in height than the total page content, the footer will still stick to the bottom of the page.
      I also set the font-size of some containers, such as &lt;div&gt;, to 1em so that they did not try to influence the font size of their contents.
      I also added some more padding to table links to make them easier to click on or press in a mobile setting. Lastly, I carefully looked through each page of the final site and documentation to make sure everything looked consistent. I then made several changes to make the entire project look cohesive.</p><br/>
      <br/>
      <p class="pQuestion">2. What did you learn while creating your project?</p><br/>
      <p>I learned a lot about CSS techniques, such as padding, margins, styling lists, the meaning of em units, and how to horizontally and vertically center content. I also learned about the difference between padding and margin, as well as different ways of positioning elements to create a flexible web page.</p><br/>
      <br/>
      <p class="pQuestion">3. Are there any sections that do not work as well as you would like? For example, do your pages display correctly in all major browsers?</p><br/>
      
      <p>All of the sections of the site itself work the way I intended and display correctly in all browsers. However, the Bibliography looks best when viewed using Firefox. I used a trial-and-error approach to find the best way to make the site look appealing and flow naturally. For example, I thought of several ways to do a task, such as vertically centering title text on a page in a graphic with a slight offset. However, several of my ideas did not work or conflicted with the home button on the bottom-left corner of the graphic. I kept trying until I found a solution that worked with different font-sizes and amounts of text.</p>
