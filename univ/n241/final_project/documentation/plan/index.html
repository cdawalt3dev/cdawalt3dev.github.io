      <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of the History of Calculators website is to show visitors how calculators have progressed over time. The website will be visually appealing; it will be full of historical information and colorful graphics. However, it will not be cluttered with too many details that could be considered overwhelming; it should be interesting to children as well as adults.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <h2>Needs Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        The website will provide information so that the visitors can learn about the history of calculators, which will be covered by dividing their history into the following categories:
      </p>
      <br/>
      <ul>
        <li>Pre-Mechanical Calculators</li>
        <li>Mechanical Calculators</li>
        <li>Electronic Calculators</li>
        <li>Modern Calculators</li>
        <li>Contact information for the visitors to ask questions or to request that information be added/edited</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Provide a visually appealing website.</li>
        <li>Provide lots of detailed information about the evolution of calculators.</li>
        <li>Include lots of colorful images and pictures.</li>
        <li>Make sure that the material is easy to read and understand but not too simplistic.</li>
        <li>Provide contact information so that the visitors can ask questions and/or request that the material be edited.</li>
      </ol>
      <br/>
      <h2>Audience Characteristics</h2>
      <p>
        Visitors to the History of Calculators will be adults and children who have an interest in technology and science.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <h3>Primary Audience</h3>
      <p>
        	The primary audience will be adults who are interested in technology and intrigued by the extensive history of calculators. Those adults old enough to remember a time when calculators were large, expensive, and had limited functionality will enjoy the technological journey from the time when calculators made the transition from the business world to the average household.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <h3>Secondary Audience</h3>
      <p>
       	The secondary audience will be children and adolescents who wish to explore the history behind the familiar and compact modern calculator.  They will delve into the roots that go back thousands of years to the early abacus and follow the transition to mechanical and then electronic calculators. The information will be easy enough to digest but not so detailed that they will lose interest.
      </p>

      <h2>Competition</h2>
      <p>
        I searched the internet to find other websites that discuss the evolution of calculators. I could not find another website that simply and concisely discussed the evolution of calculators but also included stimulating graphics and photos. One of websites was full of information but I felt the material was too complex to keep children engaged. Another website was brief and concise but not visually appealing; it lacked pictures and interesting graphics.
      </p>

        The first website I looked at was Vintage Calculator Web Museum (<a href="http://www.vintagecalculators.com/html/calculator_time-line.html">http://www.vintagecalculators.com/html/calculator_time-line.html</a>).
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        First Impressions:
      </p>
      <br/>
      <ul>
        <li>The website is not very exciting.</li>
        <li>There is lots of information that is easy to understand.</li>
        <li>The information is laid out in chronological order, which I liked.</li>
        <li>The first third of the table does not contain any images.</li>
        <li>The sans-serif font is easy to read.</li>
        <li>I like the thumbnails of the calculators by the links, but they interrupt the flow of the text when text is wrapped around the them.</li>
        <li>I found the use of separate fonts in the title a little odd.</li>
        <li>The background texture of the page is nice.</li>
        <li>The website is not centered.</li>
        <li>I would give this website a 7 out of 10. I think the designers should have spent more time adding graphics and more color. Also, they should have also put the content in its own boxes, instead of only using the page background.</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
      <p>
        The second website I looked at was the Calculator Site (<a href="https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/articles/units/history-of-the-calculator.php?page=2">https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/articles/units/history-of-the-calculator.php?page=2</a>).
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        First Impressions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The colorful, large images are nice.</li>
        <li>The page is a tad too skinny (area for content is not wide enough). A lot of space is taken up by the initial sidebar and never reclaimed after the sidebar ends.</li>
        <li>There is too much information to keep children interested.</li>
        <li>I like the color combination of the blue background and orange / grey heading text.</li>
        <li>I like the heading graphic. It has some layered complexity.</li>
        <li>I would give this website an 8 out of 10. The designers should have made better of space.  The space that the sidebar took up should have been used for word wrap for the rest of the content.</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
      <p>
        My overall impression is that the first website is too basic and bland, whereas the second website offers too much detailed information. I would like for my website to be a nice balance of the two.  I did find many of the colors and fonts used on each website attractive. I will concentrate on making my website look visually appealing and consistent.
