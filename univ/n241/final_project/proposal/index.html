      <h3>Topic</h3>
      <p class="pQuestion">
        What is the topic of your project?
      </p><br/>
      <p> The topic of my project is the history of calculators.</p><br/>
      <br/>
      <p class="pQuestion">
        Why did you choose this topic?
      </p><br/>
      <p>
        I would like to learn more about how calculators have evolved.
      </p><br/>
      <br/>
      <p class="pQuestion">
        What background knowledge do you bring to this topic?
      </p><br/>
      <p>
        I am a computer science major. Calculators were primitive computers, so I will enjoy learning how calculators have changed over the year.
      </p><br/>
      <br/>
      <p class="pQuestion">
        Who is your intended audience?
      </p><br/>
      <p>
         My intended audience would be people like myself who enjoy working with computers; calculators were like mini computers at the time and something people still use today. Also, people who are old enough to remember a time before calculators were inexpensive and common would enjoy learning about how they have changed over time. Lastly, children who are interested in technology would enjoy learning about calculators if the website is not too complex and overwhelming.
