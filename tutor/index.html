			I have experience in programming tutoring. I helped students in a highschool course that taught C++ and HTML as well as students in several university classes. I have also assisted some outside of courses in learning a programming language or setting up form-based websites. I feel that learning someone's first language can be one of the most daunting tasks in programming since there is often very little to relate issues to. Most self-help resources require some understanding of basic concepts and vocabulary before they can become useful. This can be helped greatly by having someone available to answer questions. Once a certain level is reached, the beginner can phrase their questions in a way that is more likely to lead to relevant places. It will become easier to relate answers to existing questions to their own problems.

			Most of my tutoring sessions are conducted through TeamViewer, a screensharing program that comes with a virtual whiteboard to draw on the receiver's screen and take control of the mouse/keyboard if the receiver is not using them.

			I am most comfortable helping with the C/C++ family of languages, including Java and Python. Java seems to be a nice compromise between the overwhelming specifics and fragility of C/C++ and the convenience but loss of control (assumptions made by the compiler/interpreter) from a higher level language such as Python.  The ways that Java differs from C/C++ are mainly in simplifying or implying C features (such as pointers) that are easy to explore later separtely, making Java a good bridge to picking up C or C++ later, which many other languages are also rooted in. Java also comes with cross-platform UI support, although similar options for C++ exist such as QT. It is still good to learn at least a few programming languages to pick up on concepts common in all programming rather than memorize the syntax of any one language.

			I am also comfortable helping with the XML family, particularly HTML and its common assisting languages (Javascript and CSS). Javascript is easy to relate to C in simple tasks. In HTML, it is important to understand that elements are contained within other elements and why arrangements in certain ways can be desired.

			Although it is a good first step to be able to make programs that compile with little assistance, this does not mean a program is finished. A computer can only do what it is told no matter the intent behind the script. Experience can help prevent mismatches between the developer's intentions and the real effects of running the script that lead to logic errors. These are difficult to locate and fix, especially in a complicated project with many moving parts.
