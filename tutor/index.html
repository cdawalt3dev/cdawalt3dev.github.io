			I have offered voluntary tutoring in programming for years. I helped students in a highschool course that taught c++ and HTML as well as students in university classes involving c++. I have also assisted some outside of courses in learning a programming language or setting up form-based websites.

		    Learning someone's first language can be one of the most difficult hurdles to overcome. Most self-help resources require some understanding of basic concepts and vocabulary before they become useful. Early compiler errors can be vague and difficult for a beginner to find helpful. In environments that conceal mistakes/errors by default, such as HTML/Javascript, failing to see errors may frustrate beginners who can't find the cause of a problem. It is also possible to create web pages or programs that do not cause any build or runtime errors yet still behave incorrectly.  These frustrations can be helped greatly by having someone available to answer questions and look for common mistakes. Once a certain level is reached, a beginner can phrase questions in a way that is more likely to lead to relevant information. It also becomes easier to find relevance in portions of similar questions/answers or other resources.

			I am most comfortable helping with the C family of languages, including Java and Python. Java seems to be a nice compromise between the fragility of C/C++ and the convenience of a higher level language such as Python.  The ways that Java differs from C/C++ are mainly in simplifying or implying C features (such as pointers) that are easy to explore later separtely, making Java a good bridge to picking up C/C++ later. Java also comes with cross-platform UI support, although similar options for C++ exist such as QT and wxWidgets. It is still good to compare a few different programming languages early on to pick up important concepts applicable to most languages instead of only memorizing the syntax of any one language.

			I am also comfortable helping with the XML family, particularly HTML and its commonly associated languages, Javascript and CSS. HTML handles the layout of information on a page by storing content across elements in a heirarchy.  Elements can contain other elements and group them together and/or impact their placement on the page.  Javascript is easy to relate to C and handles simple interactivity beyond clickable HTML links.  CSS covers simple appearance-related information best kept separate from the page layout, such as borders, font/graphic colors, and text alignment.

			Most of my tutoring sessions are conducted through TeamViewer, a screensharing program that comes with a virtual whiteboard to draw on the receiver's screen and take control of the mouse/keyboard if the receiver is not using them.

			Although it is a good first step to be able to make programs that compile with little assistance, this does not mean a program is finished. A computer can only do what it is told no matter the intent behind the script. Experience can help prevent mismatches between the developer's intentions and the real effects of running the script that lead to logic errors. These are difficult to locate and fix, especially in a complicated project with many moving parts.
