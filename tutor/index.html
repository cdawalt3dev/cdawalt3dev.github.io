			I have voluntarily offered to tutor programming students for several years. I have helped both high school and college students in C++ and HTML.

			Learning a programming language for the first time can be one of the most difficult hurdles to overcome. Most self-help programming resources assume some understanding of basic concepts and vocabulary. Early compiler errors can be vague and difficult for a beginner with little sense of direction to find helpful. In environments that tend to conceal errors, such as a browser running HTML/JavaScript, the lack of error reporting may also frustrate beginners. It is also possible to create web pages or programs that do not cause any build or runtime errors yet produce undesirable results. Having someone available to answer questions and look for common mistakes can lead to less frustration.

			I am most comfortable helping with the C family of languages, including Java and Python. Java is a nice compromise between the fragility of C/C++ and the convenience of a higher level language such as Python. The ways that Java differs from C are mainly in simplifying or implying C features (such as pointers) that are easy to explore separately, making Java a good bridge to picking up C/C++ or several other languages later. Java also comes with cross-platform UI support, although similar options for C++ exist such as QT and wxWidgets. It is still good to try and compare a few different programming languages early on to pick up important concepts applicable to most languages, instead of only memorizing the syntax of any one language.

			I am also comfortable helping with the XML family, particularly HTML and its commonly associated languages, JavaScript and CSS. HTML handles the layout of information on a page by storing content across elements in a heirarchy. Elements can contain other elements and impact their placement on the page. Frustrations can arise from mistakes in syntax, although, for better or worse, HTML still tries to work with improper script without reporting errors. HTML validation tools and coloring elements to show their bounds can make tracking down problems easier. JavaScript is easy to relate to C++ in simple use and handles interactivity beyond clickable HTML links. CSS covers more specific appearance-related information best kept separate from the content and organization, such as borders, font/graphic colors, and text alignment. It can also be used to make the site more adaptive to different screen sizes, such as using a two column layout on desktop/tablet devices and a single column layout for mobile phones.

			Most of my tutoring sessions are conducted through TeamViewer, a screen sharing program.  It allows the viewer to draw on the receiver's screen like a virtual whiteboard and take control of the mouse/keyboard when the receiver is not using them.
