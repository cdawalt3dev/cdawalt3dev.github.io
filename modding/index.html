			I started Goldsource and Source engine modding during highschool, as part of the group Cobalt-57.

			After several smaller projects, I was given the role of lead programmer for a mod of Half-Life called Absolute Zero.

		  <p class="pContent"> 
		  	This mod was to be a re-imagination of the game as suggested by pre-release screenshots and magazine advertisements leading up to the game's release.  Several described ambitious features promised but cut at various stages of development.

		    I was given a copy of the Half-Life SDK with some work done by others who had since left the mod group.  Over the next 5 years, I handled nearly everything related to the codebase.  This helped me learn C and C++ alongside my university classes.
			
		  </p>
		  <p class="pContent">
			I finished the AI script for the unfinished creatures and for a few new ones. Four variants of the ingame heads-up display were created to reflect different stages of development.  Nearly every weapon in the game has been modified in some significant way (attachable silencer for the glock, finer shotgun handling, significantly different gauss and gluon behavior and firing effects, etc.).  Several pathfinding glitches present in the retail game were fixed (creatures no longer flinch in place if a destination cannot be reached).

		    The mod was released to steam on July 10, 2020 (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/812440/HalfLife_Absolute_Zero/">link</a>) to receive feedback at its current stage.  It may be downloaded if logged into a steam account that has purchased Half-Life.  Despite being unfinished, 74%-80% of reviews were positive over time.
		  </p>
          <p class="pContent"> 
			Unfortunately, the mod has been put on indefinite hiatus since October 12, 2020 because the mod group has been unable to find someone to fill the role of mapper.  Most points needed from a programming standpoint have already been handled.  The mod is fully functional for many maps, although not all creatures in the codebase are used in these maps.
		  </p>
		  <p class="pContent"> 
		  	In case it becomes delisted from steam, it may still be downloaded from a <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-absolute-zero">ModDB page</a> and run through an installation of Half-Life on the user's machine.

			Currently, the mod group is exploring the open-source, partially Quake-compatible OGRE engine.  Our own open-source, Goldsource-compatible engine for use in running previous mods and entirely new projects would be a valuable asset.
