			I started Goldsource and Source engine modding during high school.

			After several smaller projects, I was given the role of lead programmer for a mod of Half-Life called Absolute Zero.

		  <p class="pContent"> 
		  	This mod was to be a re-imagination of the game as suggested by pre-release screenshots and magazine advertisements leading up to the game's release.  Several ambitious features were promised but cut at various stages of development.

		    I was given the codebase, a copy of the Half-Life SDK with some work done by others who had since left the mod group.  Over the next five years, I handled nearly everything related to the codebase.  This helped me learn C and C++ alongside my university classes.
			
		  </p>
		  <p class="pContent">
			I finished the AI script for several unfinished creatures and for a few new ones. I created four variants of the in-game heads-up display to reflect different stages of development.  I also modified nearly every weapon in the game (attachable silencer for the glock, finer shotgun handling, different behavior in other weapons and firing effects, bugfixes to issues that remained in the retail game, etc.).  I also fixed several pathfinding glitches present in the retail game; creatures no longer flinch in place if a destination cannot be reached.

		    The mod was released to Steam on July 10, 2020 (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/812440/HalfLife_Absolute_Zero/">link</a>) to receive feedback at its then current stage.  It may be downloaded if logged into a Steam account that has purchased Half-Life.  Despite being unfinished, 74%-80% of reviews have been positive.
		  </p>
          <p class="pContent"> 
			Unfortunately the mod has been put on indefinite hiatus since October 12, 2020 because the mod group has been unable to find someone to fill the role of mapper.  Most points needed from a programming standpoint have already been handled.  The mod is fully functional for many maps, although not all creatures in the codebase are used in these maps.
		  </p>
		  <p class="pContent"> 
		  	In case it becomes delisted from steam, it may still be downloaded from a <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-absolute-zero">ModDB page</a> and run through an installation of Half-Life on the user's machine.

		    Changes before this date are documented in changelog files made before this repository was created which will be made available publicly at a later date.

			Currently, the mod group is exploring the possibility of developing our own open-source, Quake-based engine.  Our own Goldsource-compatible engine for use in running previous mods and entirely new projects would be a valuable asset.
