			I have written several console and GUI utilities in Java.  Most are very situational but have the potential to be developed into more polished, user-friendly forms.

			CustoSearch is a file search app. It searches all files under a given path with certain file extensions for a string. The extension list and choices of searching through filenames and/or contents are customizable. Files to be searched are loaded as byte streams for improved performance.

			AutoKey lets a certain key (F2 by default) initiate a series of keystrokes including tabs, returns, and username/password pastes.  The program may also double as a keychain; login info stored in multiple keystrokes may be saved to encrypted files and accessed by a single password for re-use when opening the program again.  The action key is detected globally, regardless of whether the AutoKey window is in focus unlike most Java programs.  This was done using a C++ hook into Windows, as global keypress detection is not natively supported by Java.

			Most other apps are console-only and very specialized.  One app reads in pairs of search terms and replacements to find/apply across all files in a directory with a list of allowed file extensions and optional case sensitivity.  One uses the HTML-Unit library to save images or other content from a gallerty or forum given login credentials if necessary.  Another can swap the folder structure of a project, such as changing folders in the form 'project/side/game' to 'project/game/side' or vice versa. This includes adjusting any references to affected files to reflect the modified paths.
