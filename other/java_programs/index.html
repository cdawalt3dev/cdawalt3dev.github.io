			I have made several console and GUI utilities in Java.  Most are very situational but have the potential to be developed into more polished, user-friendly forms.

			CustoSearch is a file search tool. It search all files in a folder with a choice of extensions to search and the choice of searching filenames and/or contents. The app loads files as byte streams to reduce the time needed to read each file.

			AutoKey lets a certain key (F2 by default) initiate a series of keystrokes given ahead of time including tabs, returns, and pastes of usernames and passwords. Each series of keystrokes can be given the username and password to paste. The app can also double as a secure way to store passwords by locking the keystroke data with a password through encryption and requiring a successful password entry to decrypt for usage between closing and opening.  The F2 key press can be detected regardless of whether the app is in focus unlike most Java apps.  The same C++ hookup used to achieve this can also be used to stop automated bots that control the mouse for long periods of time.

			Most other apps I made are console-only and very specialized.  I made an app that reads in pairs of terms to find and their replacements across all files in a directory given a list of extensions and case sensitivity choice.  Another can search for text strings leftover in compiled files.  One uses the HTML-Unit library to search for and save images or other content in a gallerty or forum given login credentials.  Another can swap the folder structure of a project and edit project files accordingly (which must refer to files in the new locations), such as changing folders such as project/side/game to proejct/game/side and vice versa.
