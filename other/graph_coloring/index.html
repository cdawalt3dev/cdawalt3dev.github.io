			For my theory of computation class, I was assigned to a group project to demonstrate the NP-completeness of the graph coloring problem. The motivation for the problem is said to come from early cartographers who needed to know the minimum number of colors needed to color countries such that no two adjacent countries have the same color. This can also be modeled with a graph of connected nodes where nodes represent countries and connections represent adjacency.

		    Two algorithms were made to find a way of coloring a given graph such that no two connected nodes match in color: a deterministic and a nondeterministic one. The deterministic algorithm is brute force; it tries every combination of node colorings possible and is guaranteed to find a solution if one exists; running out of attempts without finding a solution proves none exists.  However, it is unweildy for larger graph sizes as the number of combinations becomes overwhelming.  The nondeterministic algorithm starts by coloring a node and successively colors neighboring nodes to comply with all connected nodes. A legal graph coloring is produced by coloring an additional node and used as a basis for coloring an additional node connected to the frontier of uncolored nodes connected to colored nodes. Backtracking (uncoloring nodes) to color nodes differently if a legal graph coloring cannot be found at some step. Although this algorithm will both succeed and admit failure at far fewer computations than the deterministic algorithm, it is difficult to guarantee that its failure is proof that no such solution exists for a given maximum number of colors.

		    I created a Java app for the project to let the user build graphs and test both algorithms on them. It allows nodes to be placed, moved, deleted, and connected with other nodes with a user-friendly interface. Graphs may also be saved and loaded for returning to between separate runs of the program. The user may use a deterministic or nondeterministic algorithm to attempt to color all the nodes with at most a number of colors specified.  The default, the most connections of any one node with other nodes plus 1, is expected to be achievable for any graph. A lower maximum number of colors may be achievable for some graphs.

		    While running, the algorithm shows how long it has been running and the number of steps (or computations) done while running.  It will either end on a valid coloring for all nodes or admit failure.  Nondeterministic algorithms may be run in step mode to show the partial graph coloring at each step.  The algorithm advances when the user presses 'Next'.
